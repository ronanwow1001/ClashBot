## Altis Discord Bot

Discord bot for the PA discord.

#### Config

Make a copy of the config_example.py and rename it to config.py

We've made the bot easy to config, fill out the info using Discord ID's

You can get the ID's by right clicking something in discord after enabling developer mode

The limiting_role variable should be the name of the role that limits users from channels.

Fill out blacklist.py with words which the bot should auto delete.
